# books-cli

Interface to store and minipulate reading logs in the command line.

Goal: Provide finer granularity (than GoodReads) for logging reading progress/habits.


## Todos

 - [ ] Make into standalone package
 - [ ] Add some sort of filter for 'currently reading'
 - [ ] Needs actual CLI interface (with argument parsing) for simple logging.
 - [ ] Provide way to make stub files if they don't exist (probably setup.csv)
 - [ ] Dynamically update 'freshness' of cached data frames
 - [ ] Handle multiple authors with same name
 - [ ] Documentation
